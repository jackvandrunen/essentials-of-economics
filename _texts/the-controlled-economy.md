*The origin of the modern planned economy. The "weaknesses" of the
system of free enterprise and their supposed remedies. The "lack of
mobility of resources." The "unjust distribution of wealth."
Redistribution and confiscation. Government control of prices and wages.
Foreign-exchange controls and restrictions on international trade.
Planning in the backward countries. Planning and communism*.

During the First World War the governments of the belligerent countries
as well as of some neutral countries demanded of their parliaments the
power to interfere in economic affairs. They justified these demands on
such grounds as military secrecy, the priorities required by the war
effort, and, in the neutral countries, the necessity of parrying the
blows that the violence of the conflict was directing against normal
economic life in the form of scarcity and high prices. After the war,
came the return to normalcy, with all its attendant problems, and the
supervening crises.

The waters, it seemed, would not return to their accustomed, peaceful
courses, and in Germany the word *Planwirtschaft* made its appearance.
Oblivious of the origin of the disorder, people said that the modern
economy is too complicated to be allowed to go its way all by itself; it
was necessary for "experts" to draw up plans and for the governments to
put them into effect. There was no dearth of
experts nor of governments desirous of extending the sphere of their
authority nor of bureaucrats ready to take advantage of opportunities
for easy and well-paid jobs in the new offices that governmental
intervention in economic affairs required. There followed a veritable
flood of books on the *controlled economy* or *economic planning*.
Franklin D. Roosevelt embarked on the New Deal in the United States,
with results absolutely spectacular and
deceptive.[^fn1] Lord Keynes
published his *General Theory of Employment, Interest and
Money*,[^fn2] the schools of
economics produced at top speed generations of pedantic "economists" who
saw the way to paradise in the unending expansion of the civil service,
and the world was overwhelmed by an epidemic of government "controls"
that recalled the dreadful outbreak of influenza that also followed the
First World War.

The "planners" want, so they say, to save the system of free enterprise;
yet in fact they are themselves, as Friedrich von Hayek has demonstrated
in his famous book, *The Road to
Serfdom*[^fn3] the---albeit in
many cases unwitting---harbingers of communism. Their aim, as stated by
W. A. Lewis,[^fn4] is to remedy
the "weaknesses" of the system of free enterprise, which allegedly
consist in the lack of mobility of resources, the unjust distribution of
wealth, and the absence of equilibrium in international trade. The
remedies proposed for these "weaknesses" are, briefly, taxes and
subsidies, government intervention to fix wages and prices,
foreign-exchange controls, and restrictions on international trade.

It is proposed that the alleged lack of mobility of resources be
corrected by the imposition of taxes on *idle money* that does not find
its way into the market and by means of subsidies for *essential
industries*. The first is the remedy of Keynesianism, and the second is
the policy of *expansionism*. Measures that succeed in stimulating
people to buy have the effect of pushing up commodity prices and
inducing a rise in the cost of living, because if more money finds its
way into the market without any concomitant increase in the supply of
goods available, the latter rise in price. On the other hand, the money
that is offered for these goods in the market does not go into
investments: it is not used to build houses or to increase industrial
installations, both of which are prerequisites
of an increase in the standard of living. What is needed to bring about
an improvement in people's well-being is to bring, not more money into
the market, but more goods that can be bought with the same amount of
money or even with less, if that is possible.

Hence, it is considered necessary to complement this policy by
stimulating production. No account is taken of the fact that the best
way of accomplishing this end is to provide an incentive for money to
enter production rather than to enter the market for consumers' goods.
Instead, what is done is exactly the contrary. And then, for lack of
private resources, public funds must be allocated to production; that
is, instead of channeling into productive enterprises the money of those
who have saved it, what is used for this purpose is public funds, which,
in the last analysis, have to be taken away from the consumers. The
latter, as a result of this combination of policies, lose both ways:
through the increase in prices and through the taxes designed to pay for
the subsidies. And when the taxes imposed on the consumers do not
produce enough revenue, the governments resort to inflation and a policy
of currency expansion, thereby imposing an additional burden on the
consumer, because it makes his money worth less.

Thus, the money that was supposed to be withdrawn from saving and
investment in order to enter the market for consumers' goods finally
finds its way into investment anyway through taxes and inflation, but it
does not do so by way of the normal channels. Instead, the government is
given discretionary power to dispose of private property as it sees fit
and, in effect, to direct production in accordance with plans inspired
by utopian economic ideas or, what is worse and no less frequent, by
concern for the interests of pressure groups. What is produced is no
longer what the consumer demands, but what the government wants; and the
consumer finds himself deprived of his right to choose, that is, of his
liberty, guaranteed by the constitution, but in fact taken away by the
government and replaced by a state of tutelage.

Let us next turn our attention to the
so-called *unjust distribution of wealth*. Efforts to correct this
supposed unjust distribution are made sometimes by way of taxation and
sometimes by way of government interference in the determination of wage
rates and prices.

State intervention by way of taxation is of either a corrective or a
confiscatory character. In regard to the first, Professor Lewis says
that in England twenty per cent of the national income goes to two per
cent of the population, that this is excessive, and that half of the
income of this minority should be taken away by taxation. He fails to
take into account three facts:

1.  These so-called privileged people are also the ones who already pay
the greater part of the taxes without needing to be especially singled
out for this purpose.

2.  Most of what they earn they do not consume, because the capacity for
consumption is limited, however prodigal and extravagant may be its
scale (though in that case, according to Keynes, it performs a useful
service for society, because it brings money to the market). Their
earnings go chiefly into investments: the construction of houses and the
production of goods and services beneficial to the community and tending
to raise and improve the general standard of living.

3.  The *redistribution* of this surplus would not result in any
appreciable gain for those in the lower income brackets (scarcely ten
per cent, in fact), and, on the other hand, the money so distributed
would find its way into the market for consumers' goods and raise their
prices, while being withdrawn from investments. The effect of such a
policy must be to make commodities even scarcer and prices even higher
than they already are.

Nevertheless, Lewis and those of his persuasion, not content with such
measures, go on to propose the outright *confiscation of capital*. They
want to take capital out of private hands by means of confiscatory
legislation and turn it over to the government. And what would the
government do with the money? It can do only one of two things: either
spend it in an unproductive way (e.g., by expanding the bureaucracy and
the police force or embarking on a
questionable program of public works), in which case production is
curbed while the population continues to increase and the general
standard of living falls; or else employ the money in production
directly or through so-called semipublic or "autonomous" agencies,
which, for all practical purposes, is socialism---the very thing that
the protagonists of a controlled economy profess to wish to avoid with
their measures to correct the "weaknesses of a free economy."

Along these same lines, and "to mitigate the sufferings of the poor,"
the advocates of a controlled economy propose to redistribute wealth
through the control of prices and wages---but not of all prices and
wages, for that would be socialism, which, they say, they wish to avoid.
They want to fix the prices of *essential articles of consumption* that
might otherwise sometimes be out of reach of the poor. But this project,
so well-intentioned in theory, proves impossible in practice. No
producer will be willing to continue in an unprofitable line of
production, for it must be remembered that commodities are expensive,
not because of the whim of the producer---free competition takes care of
that---but because of their costs of production. If the government fixes
prices below costs, the producer either will cease production entirely
or will have to be subsidized. And as the subsidies are paid by the
government out of the public treasury, the result is that what the
consumer saves in price he pays in taxes. On the other hand, the very
cheapness of a product leads to its more prodigal consumption, and it
soon becomes necessary to resort to a policy of *rationing*. But this
too fails to solve the problem. When there is rationing, everyone makes
sure to take the full amount of his allotted quota even if he does not
need it, for in that case he can resell it in the black market or use it
for less urgent needs, such as feeding cattle the bread rationed for
human consumption. At the end of the last war, when the policy of
bread-rationing was abandoned in France, the government was surprised to
find that in a free market the French consumed less bread than when it
was rationed.

It is less feasible to fix wage rates. Even Lewis
recognizes, for example, that a general
increase in wages is futile, because it inevitably gives rise to a
corresponding, and sometimes greater, increase in prices. Nevertheless,
he insists that wage rates be raised in those cases in which they are
too low. But when this happens, it is precisely because market prices do
not allow of higher wages, since the commodities in question are in
abundant supply. If, in such circumstances, wage rates are raised,
production becomes unprofitable, the industry in question disappears,
the market is deprived of its product, and the workers engaged in its
production, finding themselves unemployed, enter the competition for
jobs in other industries, whose wage rates they thereby depress.

---

General monetary controls will not concern us here. But there is a
special type of monetary control---*foreign-exchange control*---that,
for all practical purposes, is nothing but a particular method of
controlling international trade.

The control of international trade is characteristic of tendencies
toward both nationalism and socialism. It began almost simultaneously in
the Soviet Union and in nationalist Germany. There is nothing
extraordinary in this, since nationalism inevitably leads to socialism,
and socialism to nationalism. Practically every socialist regime has to
be nationalist, and vice versa: in either case what is involved is
simply a form of *totalitarianism*. It is not possible to put a
nationalist economic policy into effect without taking over control of
production and distribution, and this is what socialism is essentially.
On the other hand, it is impossible to take over control of production
and distribution without inevitably putting into effect a policy of
economic nationalism. In both cases there is but one producer and
distributor, viz., the state. Sometimes, as in the Germany of Hitler and
the Italy of Mussolini, the appearance of an economy of free enterprise
is kept up, but in fact it is not that at all, because the producer and
the distributor have no other alternative than to obey the regulations
established by the state. As a German industrialist said during the
Hitler era, "The difference between Russia and Germany consists in the
fact that in Russia the producer is a
bureaucrat who neither reaps profits nor suffers losses, whereas in
Germany he is a bureaucrat who only suffers losses."

The advocates of a controlled economy become indignant when they are
accused of being nationalists and socialists and consider themselves the
saviors of free enterprise in a period of crisis. They recognize, as
does Professor Lewis, the superiority of international exchange on the
world market under a regime of free, private enterprise, but they
nevertheless champion a policy of government intervention because they
have not been able to liberate themselves from the myth of the
*Volkswirtschaft*. The international free economy is the best, says
Professor Lewis, but it "needs to be strengthened" by means of
government intervention in order to maintain an *equilibrium in the
balance of payments*. And what can the state do to maintain this
equilibrium?

It is not possible, says Professor Lewis, to attain equilibrium by
restricting imports.

> National income cannot be increased by avoiding imports, since this will
> result only in diverting resources to the production of articles of
> domestic consumption, thereby withdrawing them from the most profitable
> export markets. Nor can domestic employment be increased by reducing
> imports because this would reduce exports to the same extent.

His solution is, like that of all the advocates of planning, neither to
restrict nor expand international commerce as a whole, but to divert it
by facilitating or impeding certain imports and exports in order to
bring about corrective adjustments dictated by political or ideological
considerations. The method chosen for accomplishing this end is
foreign-exchange control. There are many varieties of foreign-exchange
control, but it consists essentially in the state's collecting the price
of exports and paying for imports, on behalf of the interested parties,
in sound money (gold or dollars), but paying the exporter and recovering
from the importer an arbitrarily determined amount in the national
currency.

In sum, imports are paid for with the proceeds
from exports, and the former extend only as far as the latter permit,
exactly as in a free economy. The only difference is that in this case
neither the importer nor the exporter is a free agent in carrying on his
business, nor does either one of them receive or pay the world market
price, but an arbitrarily set price. The distribution thereby effected
is unjust and discriminatory, besides being burdened with the expenses
of government intervention. Hence, this system of intervention does not
succeed in achieving either a more equitable distribution of wealth or a
greater mobility of goods and labor or even an increase in international
trade. On the contrary, such state intervention is unnecessary, costly,
arbitrarily discriminatory, and extremely detrimental to individual
liberty.

---

From this brief exposition of the principles underlying the controlled
economy two conclusions clearly emerge: (1) They in no way succeed in
avoiding the "weaknesses of a free economy." (2) They produce, instead,
new evils, viz., scarcity, high prices, and the suppression of
individual liberty. Nevertheless, as a last line of defense, it is
proposed that they be applied to the so-called *backward countries*.

Thus, Earl Parker Hanson, the great
explorer,[^fn5] believes in the
economy of free enterprise, but recommends, nevertheless, a planned
economy for the backward countries in order to accelerate their progress
without waiting for them to undergo the normal development that
individual initiative would bring about.

Interesting in this respect is the opinion of Lewis, himself an advocate
of economic planning, as expressed in his little book on the subject, so
often cited here, in which there is an appendix especially devoted to a
consideration of this question. He says there:

> . . . . planning requires a strong, competent, and incorrupt government.
> . . . .
> 
> Now a strong, competent, and incorrupt administration is just what no
> backward country possesses, and, in the absence of such an
> administration, it is often much better that
> governments should be laissez faire than that they pretend to plan. . .
> . .
> 
> But the difficulty which faces these governments is that they cannot
> expand their own services unless they can raise money to pay for them,
> and they cannot raise all the money they need because their peoples are
> too poor. . . . .
> 
> If governments of backward countries try to finance their investments by
> creating money, they will cause an inflation. . . . .
> 
> Foreign capital cannot be avoided, even if the government decides to
> build and operate all the plants itself. The machinery must come from
> abroad; . . . . backward countries are too poor to be able to provide
> much capital simply by cutting down luxuries. If they are to
> industrialize themselves substantially, they have either to cut severely
> the consumption of necessaries, or else to borrow abroad. A ruthless
> dictatorship can cut consumption to the desired extent, but a democracy
> will always have to rely largely on foreign capital. . . . .

And he concludes as follows:

> It can thus be seen that planning in backward countries imposes much
> bigger tasks on governments than does planning in advanced countries. .
> . . . For, if the people are, on their side, nationalistic, conscious of
> their backwardness, and anxious to progress, they willingly bear great
> hardships and tolerate many mistakes. . . . . Popular enthusiasm is both
> the lubricating oil of planning, and the petrol of economic development.
> . . . . We can understand the claims of Russia in the 1930's or of
> Jugoslavia today to have awakened this dynamic enthusiasm. . . .
> .[^fn6]

But what does it all lead to in the end? Is not Hayek right when he
says, in his *The Road to Serfdom*, that the controlled economy drifts
inevitably toward communism?

The policy of economic planning, then, is absolutely untenable
theoretically; but, besides, in spite of the great prestige that it
still enjoys, especially in the economically less important countries
(while those in which it was first introduced, like Germany, England,
France, and the United States, are abandoning it), its
material collapse is only a matter of time. As
Professor von Mises appropriately puts it, the countries that are
committed to a program of economic planning are giving their peoples the
illusion of prosperity at the price of liquidating their reserves. When
these are exhausted, a great catastrophe is inevitable unless the people
open their eyes before they fall over the
precipice.[^fn7]
