*Production, distribution, and consumption. Equilibrium. Homo
economicus. Types of "business associations." Social justice*.

We have seen briefly how the economy is constituted by the exercise of
man's innate faculty of choice, how it functions when it is allowed to
operate freely, how it reacts when it is hampered, and how it can be
understood, not by resorting either to arbitrary dogmatism or to merely
routine factual description, but by means of critical reflection
directed toward the discovery not only of apparent regularities in the
phenomena under observation but also of the conditions determining their
occurrence. Let us now glance briefly and in very summary fashion at
what economics is *not* about.

Let us take any of the best-known treatises of economics: the
*Principles* of Charles
Gide,[^fn1] a highly
esteemed work of which thousands and thousands of copies have been
printed in France and many other countries; the *Grundriss der
politischen Oekonomie* of
Philippovich,[^fn2] a
fundamental textbook in the education of so many German and foreign
economists; the well-known treatises of
Benham,[^fn3]
Lutz,[^fn4]
Cannan;[^fn5] and even that
of the English mathematical economist
Marshall[^fn6] or the little
manual by his disciple,
Chapman;[^fn7] etc., etc.
All of them, to a greater or lesser extent, treat production,
distribution, and consumption as separate things that have almost
nothing to do with one another. Yet the economy cannot be understood in
this fashion; for production, distribution,
and consumption are not three independent activities nor even three
separable phases of a process that can be examined by themselves or by
means of a provisional abstraction made for purposes of study or
instruction.

The economic process is an integral and continuous whole in which
production, distribution, and consumption are essentially concurrent and
coincident, so that it is not even intellectually possible to focus
attention on any one of these phases to the exclusion of the others.
Especially since credit has become generally available, he who produces
anything is, in the very process, already distributing what is produced
among the human factors of production, and the latter are consuming
their respective shares, and so on successively. Production,
distribution, and consumption are phases of the same cycle, which
repeats itself, but never in identical form. Thus, the economic process
is a succession of acts of production, distribution, and consumption,
not in the form of successive or concentric circles, but in the form of
a spiral. The economic process is living and dynamic: it never repeats
itself exactly; it always moves on to a new position.

Hence, the attachment of so many economists for the *evenly rotating
economy* is utopian rather than scientific. This was also the ideal of
the classical economists and continues to be that of many economists who
consider themselves liberals, to say nothing of those who profess
themselves adherents of the different varieties of "welfare" or "labor"
economics. This longing for a condition of static and beatific
tranquillity is essentially reactionary. It is in conflict with the very
essence of economic life and, indeed, of human life in general. It
seeks, in the words of Heine's poem, to turn the world into a paradise,
but turns it instead, to use Abraham Lincoln's apt expression, into a
hell by choking off initiative and putting creativity into a
straitjacket. The hallmark of all attempts to achieve economic stability
is always rationing and coercion; it is essentially static and
quantitative, whereas man's faculty of choice, as exercised in regard to
economic goods, is essentially dynamic and qualitative.

The essential principle of the economic process is not equilibrium,
but disequilibrium. Equilibrium would bring
about economic stagnation and death; disequilibrium is the motive force
that keeps the economy alive and progressive. Economic life is not a
condition of peace and security; it involves daring and adventure. There
is no such thing as exact economic calculation, as some mathematical
economists have maintained, because the economic data that are at our
disposal always refer to the past, and we do not know what tomorrow will
bring. Every economic activity is a bill presented to the future, and
there is always a question whether or not it will be paid. One could say
of economic life what Goethe says at the end of the second part of
*Faust*:

> Alles Vergängliche  
> Ist nur ein Gleichnis;  
> Das Unzulängliche,  
> Hier wird's Ereignis;  
> Das Unbeschreibliche,  
> Hier ist es getan[^fn8]

That is to say:

> All we see before us passing  
> Sign and symbol is alone;  
> Here, what thought could never reach to  
> Is by semblances made known;  
> What man's words may never utter  
> Done in act---in symbol shown.[^fn9]

Economics is not about anything that could be expressed in mathematical
terms; its domain is rather that of imagination and invention, of
adventure into the unknown, of a hazardous enterprise that is not for
the cowardly.

Hence, it is no less necessary to banish from economics the classical
myth of the *homo economicus*. Man is, to be sure, an egoistic being;
such is his earthly lot, for no other mode of
existence is possible to him; he is actuated by the instinct of
self-preservation. But egoism is not the same as avarice; it is, rather,
the desire for well-being. And well-being is not always expressible in
terms of material goods.

The exercise of man's faculty of choice, which is the pivot on which the
whole of economic life turns, is not confined to the kind of goods that
are bought and sold in the market. Sometimes the objects of man's
preference have no exchange-value at all. A worker prefers, at certain
times, leisure, from which he derives no material benefit, to well-paid
labor. An engineer who could earn a great deal of money by productive
employment for the market prefers to live in a secluded hovel, in the
utmost poverty, in order to solve some baffling scientific problem; this
makes him happier, just as the laborer mentioned above was made happier
by leisure than by paid employment. Or a nabob leaves his fortune to his
family or gives it to the poor in order to go and preach the Gospel. We
know of a notary who was earning large sums of money in the practice of
his profession and abandoned it to become a monk, and of the owner of a
great newspaper who left it to become a priest. And there are also cases
in which the opposite occurs, and we find old clerics and philosophers
turned into captains of industry.

Now these cases that we have cited are not instances of altruism in
opposition to the egoism of the entrepreneur. They too are cases of
egoism, for everyone who seeks his own happiness is egoistic. Some find
it in money, others in science, and still others in simple renunciation.
All exercise their faculty of choice.

Hence, in the market, if we may be permitted to use the expression,
there is competition not only among vendible goods, but also among
things that are, as we commonly say, "beyond price." There is no such
being as an "economic man" or a "noneconomic man"; there are only men
who exercise the faculty of choice, sometimes preferring vendible goods,
sometimes goods without any exchange-value.

The latter are a more important factor in economic life than is
generally believed. They are some of the many unknown facts about the
future that make economic calculation such a hazardous
adventure. The retirement of an entrepreneur
of genial disposition can bring fortune or misfortune to many other
entrepreneurs, just as the indifference of a truth-seeker to monetary
considerations can, at a given moment, make both him and others wealthy.

There are many other things which one finds in treatises on economics,
but which likewise have nothing to do with the subject. In many of them
we find pages and pages devoted to corporations, trusts, cartels,
mergers, and other forms of business associations, combinations, and
"communities of interest." These matters have nothing whatever to do
with economics; they are strictly legal questions connected with the
technical problems of organizing business. Neither is economics
concerned with the problem of *costs*, which is so much in vogue at the
moment. So-called "costs" economics is nothing but a branch of
industrial calculation, and one of lesser importance than is commonly
believed, because it is only of auxiliary value to the entrepreneur; his
economic calculation, however many data the study of costs provides him
with, always has to contend with an unknown factor that will, in any
case, render it essentially inexact and hazardous: tomorrow, time, the
*future*.

But if there is anything that, above all else, has nothing to do with
economics, it is the question of the "just distribution" of wealth, or
what is called today, in a phrase that is as seductive as it is empty,
"social justice." To speak of social justice or of the just or unjust
distribution of resources is like speaking of surrealist astronomy or of
musical chemistry, because justice and the conduct of economic affairs
are entirely distinct matters, neither related nor opposed, but simply
indifferent to each other. The goal of economic activity is a continual
increase in the production of commodities, and the only just
distribution of resources is that which best serves to attain this end.
All that "just" means, at bottom, is "fit," "suitable," "appropriate."
The aim of justice, properly so called, is, as the Romans used to say,
*to give each his due (ius suum cuique tribuendi)*, and in order for
each to be given what is his, it is necessary that *it
already belong to him*; to "give," in this
sense, means to *protect the right of possession*. Each man gets "what
belongs to him" in the course of voluntary exchanges that constitute the
economic process, and, by virtue of the operation of the market, each
receives for his contribution precisely the amount that will impel him
to increase the supply of the most urgently demanded commodities. Thus,
each one ends by getting his due only when he finally obtains it at the
completion of a cycle in the economic process, and precisely by virtue
of this process and nothing more. Only when each man thereby gets what
belongs to him, and someone wants to take it away from him, does a
question of justice arise, and not before.

"But," it will be said, "even though this economic process of constantly
increasing the supply of goods and services may, on the whole and in the
long run, be able to resolve the problem of providing for the needs of
everybody, yet in subjecting men to its own requirements, it could
become, at certain times, a veritable Procrustean bed for some of them
by imposing on them conditions harder than they could bear. Ought
society to remain indifferent to such conditions and console the victims
by telling them that later on they or their descendants will be rolling
in wealth?" Evidently not, but this is not an economic problem; it is a
moral problem---a problem of human solidarity. But why seek to solve it
only by political means---by passing laws and establishing governmental
institutions? We are here in the realm of public opinion, of education,
and, above all, of the example set by the elite. These are the forces
that can solve the grave problems of relief and security, by leaving to
the interested parties, in free association, the responsibility of
managing as they think best the resources they decide to pool in
voluntary, co-operative institutions designed with these ends in view.
There is no more reason for the state to intervene in such matters than
in the economic sphere. When it does so, under the pretext that no
confidence is to be placed in individual initiative, it simply deprives
men of their constitutional rights and liberties without giving them
anything but an illusory security and substitutes government omnipotence
for the democratic system.
