Nationalism appears to be a modern phenomenon having its origin in the
nationalities constituted in Europe between the sixteenth and the
nineteenth century concomitantly with the disappearance of feudalism and
of the Romano-Germanic Empire that came into being with Charlemagne and
was totally liquidated with the unification of Italy. In fact, however,
the spirit of nationalism is very
ancient.[^fn1] It has been and
still is present as a factor in both political and economic history. The
only thing that has changed is its form. It was this spirit that
animated the absolutist and totalitarian regime of the Egyptians, that
of the decadent Roman Empire, and the mercantilism of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries, and, after a brief eclipse that lasted from
the Congress of Vienna to the First World War, revived in the form of
the so-called controlled or planned economy under the combined influence
of war and socialism. The latter system arose as an international
movement of the working class, having as its
slogan, "Proletarians of all countries, unite!" but it has since passed
to the opposite side and now says, "Proletarians of all countries, don't
come to my country and take my job away from me!"

In its economic aspect, nationalism is based on two fallacies: the
belief in the existence of national economies and the doctrine that a
nation can prosper economically only at the expense of the rest of the
world. These convictions were among the first to be combatted by the
classical economists, but they were unable to free themselves entirely
from the myth of the national economy. Thus, Adam Smith entitled his
book *The Wealth of Nations*, and until very recently treatises on
economics bore the title "Political Economy," even when they were
antinationalistic in content.

Nothing is more illusory than the existence of a national economy and
national wealth. Nations do not own any property (the resources at the
disposal of governments consist of what they need to perform their
functions) and are neither rich nor poor; this is possible only for
individuals. In recent years the bureaucratic organs of the League of
Nations and latterly of the United Nations have spent vast sums of money
on calculating machines, writing materials, books, travel expenses, and
salaries for "economists" engaged in computing the wealth and income of
nations. All these calculations are utterly fantastic and lead
absolutely nowhere, because there is no possible way, no matter how many
laws are passed or how powerful a police organization is created, of
knowing what each individual who lives in a particular country owns or
earns. Each case is unique; the peoples' lack of confidence in their
governments is inveterate and founded on bitter experience; and the
majority refuse to divulge all that they have hidden in the house or
outside the country or to reveal what their true earnings are, even when
they are assured that this information is being sought purely for
"statistical purposes," because they fear that sooner or later these
statistical purposes will turn out to be tax collectors, if not outright
expropriators.

After the last war, France---the France of the statisticians---was
totally ruined, because the Germans had plundered everything
they could lay their hands on. And yet France
has revived and is today, in spite of the statistics, a rich country,
not because of the American aid provided by the Marshall Plan, much of
which was used for bureaucratic expenses and armaments, but simply
because the French have made use of their reserves of gold and their
foreign assets, which, in spite of the decrees and threats of Marshal
Pétain and the Germans, they succeeded in preserving from the general
pillage. The country has saved itself by virtue of the refusal of its
citizens to allow themselves to be expropriated, by their disobedience
of the decrees of stupid or traitorous governments. And the example of
France is by no means unique.

No less illusory is the myth of the economic solidarity of the citizens
of one country as opposed to the inhabitants of other countries. From
what we have already observed of the economic interdependence of all
people everywhere, it becomes manifest that it is absurd and impossible
for a country to attempt to live in *autarky* exclusively on its own
resources. No country, however extensive and diversified it may be, not
even Russia or the United States, has at its disposal all the natural
resources needed for its production and consumption. All countries have
to import, and not on a small scale, food and raw materials as well as
manufactured goods, if they are not prepared to content themselves with
a miserable subsistence dearly paid for, because there are branches of
industry that can produce at low cost only on a large scale or under
especially favorable conditions. (As we know from the law of comparative
cost and the law of returns, few countries are in a position to produce
economically heavy machinery, automobiles, etc.) They need to export in
order to pay for their imports.

For this reason, the only really integral economic whole is the
international, or rather, the world-wide, market, because, in fact,
trade takes place, not between nations, but among men and across
national frontiers. This universal economic community can be realized
only when every entrepreneur buys and sells in the markets of the whole
world. In this way, demand and supply are allowed free play and brought
into equilibrium; income and expenses balance
each other everywhere quite insensibly, without difficulties or
conflicts; and everyone adjusts himself smoothly and imperceptibly to
his possibilities. But as soon as national groups, rather than
individuals, seek to enter the market, the whole mechanism of commercial
intercourse becomes sluggish as well as dangerous, because covetous
ambitions, rivalries, and conflicts arise among armed powers.

The slogan, "Buy what the fatherland produces; produce what the
fatherland needs," has not been and cannot be of any avail at all,
because whoever is in want of a commodity buys it however and wherever
he finds it. This, indeed, is the very essence of man's innate faculty
of economic judgment and choice. On the other hand, for a country to
produce what it needs, natural conditions have to be favorable, and
there must be a sufficient demand to make production profitable, for no
one will undertake to produce a commodity, no matter how much the
country may need it, that economic calculation shows to be unprofitable
and incapable of competing on the world market.

But most absurd of all is the obsession that a country can prosper only
when it has a favorable *balance of trade*, that is, when it exports
more than it imports and receives in income more than it pays
out---which is tantamount to saying that a country can prosper only at
the expense of other countries. This was, indeed, the favorite argument
of the supporters of mercantilism, a policy whose disastrous
consequences are very well described in the book by Conrad previously
cited. What the exponents of this doctrine fail to realize is that it is
impossible to be rich in the midst of poverty, because wealth consists
in the possibility of making exchanges. Suppose, for example, that the
United States keeps on exporting year after year more than it imports,
until it finally accumulates virtually all the money of the other
countries, which have been spending all this time in importing more than
they have exported and paying the difference in gold. Either the United
States will have to use this gold to make further purchases and thereby
render its balance of payments "unfavorable," or international commerce
will have to be reduced to barter transactions
in which the people of the United States will give more than they
receive. A country prospers economically when it increases its
production of goods that, by their quality and price, are in demand in
the world market, and, with the proceeds from such sales, buys in the
same market other products which it needs and which are offered for sale
by those capable of producing them in abundance at attractive prices.

It is easy to understand that this is possible only when both buyer and
seller enjoy full liberty to exercise their initiative, not merely
within each country, but across political boundaries. Nations are not
economic, but political, communities of men who agree among themselves
on the way in which they are to live together. Exercising what the
Declaration of Independence calls the right to "the pursuit of
happiness," each man in every country undertakes to offer his fellow men
all over the world those commodities that suit them by their quality and
price, in exchange for which he obtains money; with this he and those
who have assisted him in the process of production (for they all receive
their share of the remuneration, whether for labor or for capital) buy
from other entrepreneurs on the national or international market the
commodities they need or want. This freedom of initiative and this
desire for constant improvement in well-being is what makes for
individual progress and thereby for the progress of national groups, for
the latter is nothing but the sum of the advances made by their
individual components. When, on the other hand, the activity and
initiative of individuals are regulated in view of a supposed *national
interest*, stagnation ensues, the rhythm of economic life diminishes,
conflicts arise among different groups, force is invoked, and an armed
struggle results.

In the period of great economic prosperity that comprised almost the
whole of the nineteenth century and the first years of the twentieth, no
one concerned himself about the national economy or the balance of
payments, a concept first given currency apparently by David Ricardo
(previously one spoke only of a commercial balance). Everyone was busy
producing goods or services that would find acceptance in the world
market; and this multilateral network of
productive efforts resulted in a situation in which everything produced
was bought and sold, everyone raised his standard of living, and there
never was a lack of *foreign exchange*. Indeed, up to 1914, there was
not a single case in which anyone in any country wanted to import
something and could not do so because he did not have the foreign money
needed to pay a reasonable price for it. But one day some German
economists, who were more or less in the service of the militarist and
imperialist faction, described the existence of what they called the
national economy (*Volkswirtschaft*), began to question whether Germany
was receiving a just compensation for the productive efforts of her
people, and created a psychological "complex" with regard to
international exploitation that led to the war of 1914 and later to that
of 1939.

Thereafter, day and night one began to speak of the balance of payments,
the statisticians set to work, and we learned that for a long time all
countries had been importing more than they exported. This belief led to
government intervention in international commerce, import quotas,
"dumping" (i.e., subsidized exports), and foreign-exchange controls. The
result was that as the intervention was extended and intensified, the
deficit in the balance of payments kept on increasing.

Whoever has the patience to peruse the statistics of the various nations
will be surprised to find that, all told, more merchandise is imported
in the world today than is exported, and that more gold is exported than
is imported. Naturally, this is impossible, and the explanation for it
is to be found in the fact that these statistics are all incorrect. In
the first place, they calculate the value only of those imports and
exports that are under control and visible, using the arbitrary prices
fixed by the governments for customs purposes. In the second place,
these statistics record the movements of foreign exchange (generally
today dollars, Swiss francs, or pounds sterling) made through controlled
or visible channels; no account is taken of the fact that this movement
of goods and money is not the whole of the actual movement, but only a
part. This part becomes all the smaller, the
greater the extent of government intervention,
for the latter creates and feeds the *black market*---that is to say,
the true market, since it is the free market. Yet it is on the basis of
these statistics that the economic policy of the governments is
founded---a mistaken policy that *multiplies* the very evils it is
designed to avoid. In fact, actual economic life continues to take its
course, but in a form more burdensome to the consumers, who must now pay
not only the expenses of the government's intervention, but a premium
for the risks incurred on the black market. Thus, the result of the
policy of economic nationalism is to make the countries that adopt it,
not richer, but poorer, because it inhibits economic activity and raises
prices.

Another enemy of the world-wide free market is *socialism*. The labor
movement[^fn2] began and
developed under the banner of socialism, however many may have been the
names---social democracy, syndicalism, collectivism, communism,
etc.---given, in the course of the years, to the diverse tendencies that
represent but variant expressions of the same fundamental thesis. The
word itself seems to have been coined by Robert Owen (1771--1858), an
Englishman, to signify that economic activity ought to be inspired
exclusively by altruism, and that the economy ought to be social, rather
than individualistic. In this connection, one may cite an interesting
observation by the Italian economist Pantaleoni, an adherent of the
mathematical school, who, in rebutting a criticism that accused him of
founding his economic calculations on individual egoism, wrote these
words: "You say that we start from the assumption that man is egoistic;
but, from the economic point of view, it would make no difference
whatsoever if we were to start from the assumption that man is
altruistic. Nothing more would be required than a change of sign. For
egoistic rivalry will be substituted rivalry in the spirit of sacrifice,
and free competition will continue to exist."

The leitmotif of socialism, which runs through all the different
variants of proletarian orthodoxy, was expressed in masterly fashion,
albeit in terms perhaps not altogether accurate in point
of fact, by the German poet Heinrich Heine in
the following verses:

> Ein neues Lied, ein bessres Lied,  
> Oh Freunde, will ich Euch dichten;  
> Wir wollen hier auf Erden schon  
> Das Himmelreich errichten.
> 
> Wir wollen auf Erden glücklich sein  
> Und wollen nich mehr darben;  
> Verschlemmen soll nich der faule Bauch  
> Was fleissige Händen erwarben.
> 
> Es giebt auf Erden Brot genug  
> Für alle Menschenkinder  
> Und Tulpen und Lilien und Schönheit und Lust  
> Und Zuckererbsen nicht minder.

Literally translated, these lines may be rendered thus: "I wish to
compose a new, a better song for you, my friends. We want to attain to
the kingdom of heaven while we are yet here on earth. We want to be
happy in this life and not to be in need any more. No lazy wastrel
should consume what hard-working hands have acquired. There is enough
bread on earth for all mankind, and tulips and lilies and beauty and joy
and sugarplums too."

This leitmotif consists, as we see, of two themes: abundance and
exploitation. There is, we are told, enough bread and even "sugarplums"
on earth for all men, but the "lazy wastrel" is depriving "hard-working
hands" of their rightful produce. Nevertheless:

1.  The possibilities of acquiring goods, services, and commodities of
every kind in a country within a definite period of time---a year, for
example---are represented by the total amount of money that its
inhabitants have earned in that period. This sum represents the
production of the country in the same period of time. The amount spent
on things and services, in general, is the
price of these things and services. The annual income of each individual
is the numerical expression of his part of the supply of the commodities
that are available in that year for the whole population.

Now, according to the annual report of the U.N. for 1953, the most
recent date for which we have found comparative statistics, the average
annual income per head of the population was \$1,800 in the United
States, \$957 in Switzerland, \$705 in Great Britain, \$620 in France,
\$234 in Brazil, and \$160 in Japan. In Mexico (according to the book
entitled *El desarollo económico de México* compiled by government
experts, both Mexican and American, and published by the Fondo de
Cultura Económica), the average annual income per head of the population
in 1950 was \$180 in terms of the money of that year, which was then
worth half of what it had been worth in 1930. Recent figures for India
are not available, but in 1930 the average annual income per head of the
population was less than one-tenth that of Switzerland, which would come
to about \$70. This would be what each inhabitant of these countries
could buy if the national income were divided equally among all, and if
it were expended entirely on consumption, without any deduction for
taxes or for maintaining the factors of production and increasing them
at least in proportion to the increase in the population. In the light
of these figures, Heinrich Heine could hardly say today that there is in
the world enough for everybody to have not only bread but "sugarplums."
Instead, he would agree with the statement of the late Charles Gide, the
French economist, that Adam Smith should have entitled his book, not
*The Wealth of Nations*, but *The Poverty of Nations*.

2.  The United States has the reputation of being the capitalist country
par excellence and the one in which the national wealth is most
inequitably distributed. Nevertheless, according to the statistics of
the Federal Reserve System, 70 per cent of the national income goes to
wages and salaries, 20 per cent to professional people, tradesmen, and
independent artisans, and only 10 per cent to those receiving interest,
dividends, and rents.

Around 1953, the *American Economic Review* published
a study made by the National Bureau of
Economic Research which showed that, after taxes, the average annual
income of the richest 7 per cent of the population was \$3,267 per
person and of the remaining 93 per cent of the population \$1,124 per
person. If the income of the upper 7 per cent were divided equally among
the whole population after taxes, each individual of the remaining 93
per cent of the population would receive an additional \$150 per year;
that is, the average American per capita income would be \$1,274 per
year instead of \$1,124---an increase of somewhat more than 10 per cent.

Professor Lewis[^fn3] comes to
the same conclusion in regard to England. If the same coefficient is
applied to the rest of the countries mentioned above, the increase in
the absolute income of the average Frenchman or Mexican would be even
less. With this, they would not only have to live, but they would also
have to make provision for industrial investments, and the latter, in a
country as little industrialized as Mexico, have amounted in the last
few years, according to the book cited above, to around 14 per cent of
the national income. In order to maintain these investments, the
Mexican, after the division of the total annual output, would be left
with an average income less than he actually has at his disposal today,
and it is by no means certain that the beneficiaries of such a
redistribution in the other countries for which we have cited statistics
would not find, in the final analysis, their total income available for
consumption likewise diminished.

3.  The facts, then, belie the two fundamental theses of the socialist
critique of the so-called capitalist economy. The latter, indeed, is no
more particularly "capitalist" than any other, for capital, or a stock
of producers' goods, on however rudimentary a scale, is and always has
been a necessity in every economic system. The domestic silk-spinner and
the weaver require distaffs and hand looms; craftsmen and artisans need
more or less expensive tools and machines. The same is true of the
communist countries. Socialized industries also need fixed and
circulating capital; they too have to calculate and adjust their prices,
at least of their exports, to those of the world market. It is only
in regard to wages that the communist
countries can avoid being made subject to the laws of the market,
because wage rates are prescribed by the government, and not exactly in
favor of the workers; for, as Joseph E. Davies, the quondam American
ambassador to Russia,[^fn4] and
Walter Lippman[^fn5]
demonstrate, the differences between the wages of the workers and those
of the managers are much greater there than in the United States.

In short, the actual economic situation today is characterized, not by
abundance, but by scarcity; not by an unjust distribution of wealth, but
by inequalities corresponding to differences in productivity.

4.  For the alleged *unjust distribution of wealth* socialism, in all
its various forms, does not seek corrective measures; this is rather the
object of the so-called social reform movements, and more especially of
the "planned" or "controlled" economy. Marx formulated the aim of
socialism as the *expropriation of the expropriators*. With the
so-called *surplus value* that they allegedly withhold for themselves
from the total proceeds of the labor of those whom they employ, the
capitalists have made themselves owners of the means of production.
*They have to be deprived of their ownership of the means of
production;* i.e., their mills and factories have to be taken away from
them. On whose behalf? On behalf of the people, who will then consist
exclusively of workers. How is this to be accomplished? This is the
great problem of socialism that Kautsky discusses, without solving it,
in his pamphlet entitled *The Day after the
Revolution*.[^fn6] In general,
two tendencies have manifested themselves. The so-called social
democrats advocate that the property of private enterprise pass into the
hands of the state as the representative of the people; the followers of
Bakunin (the anarchosyndicalists) want it to pass directly into the
hands of the workers' councils. The communists envision two distinct
stages: a preparatory socialist stage, consisting of the dictatorship of
the proletariat, with production centralized by the state, and true
communism, in which the state will "wither away," leaving only the
workers' councils.

What is not seen clearly and has not been explained by anybody is what
difference all this would make in comparison
with the system of free enterprise or what
advantage the workers would derive from such a change. Production would
continue to be capitalistic and subject to the laws of the market,
which, in an economy operated by the state, would condition the prices
of imported and exported products, and consequently of all the rest. In
a syndicalist economy the free play of competition would be even more
complete. From the prices imposed by the market would have to be
deducted costs of production, financial charges, and reinvestments for
the maintenance and expansion of the capital structure. The direction of
commerce and technology would require a differential compensation such
as is, in fact, demanded and received in Russia. The remainder would be
left for the workers, as at present, but with these two differences in
their disfavor. In the first place, those responsible for the conduct of
business, not being entrepreneurs, would neither reap profits nor suffer
losses; they would be assured their own salaries, and the remainder
would be left for the ordinary workers. This is precisely the opposite
of what happens under present conditions, in which the fixed
remuneration is that of the worker, and the boss keeps the remainder, if
there is any. In the second place, under a socialist system, freedom of
labor would disappear. In the absence of a labor market, wages would be
fixed by the ukase of the monopolistic employer. The right of workingmen
to form unions and to go on strike would be suppressed, and the worker
would become a slave. This is what is happening in Russia today, where
the worker cannot choose even his place of employment, and every effort
on his part to improve his condition is punished as high treason.

A very peculiar variety of socialism is *agrarian socialism*, known also
as Georgism and as the agrarian reform
movement.[^fn7] It bases itself
on the theory of *ground rent*, already in germinal form in the works of
Adam Smith, Anderson, and Malthus, and developed by David Ricardo.
According to this doctrine, when fertile land is abundant, it does not
produce any profit, and the prices of the products are measured by the
costs of production. But when the population increases, land of the
first quality is no longer sufficient to
produce the food needed, and recourse has to be taken to land of
increasingly inferior quality. The prices of the products then rise by
an amount equivalent to the cost of cultivating the poorer land. Those
who retain possession of the better land profit from this situation by
obtaining prices greater than their costs of production and gain a
profit that includes, over and above the normal revenue, a premium,
called *ground rent*, in consideration of the superior quality of their
own land.

Shortly after the death of Ricardo, an American, Henry George, made full
use of this doctrine and developed it in his famous book, *Progress and
Poverty*, which has been translated into many languages. He contended
that the poverty of the masses is due, not to the exploitation of the
industrial worker, but to the monopoly of ground rent enjoyed by the
landlords. He therefore proposed, by means of a *single tax*, to
confiscate this rent. No country has actually made this attempt,
although progressive taxation and differences in tax rates based on
ownership of real property have been founded on this theory.

The attempts at agrarian reform made in almost all the countries of
Europe after the First World War were directed chiefly against the
owners of large landed estates and consisted in the expropriation of the
landlords, with or without compensation, and the division of the land so
as to increase small holdings. Nevertheless, Henry George had and still
has many adherents, and, up to the last world war, there were in several
countries agrarian reform movements. Very important among them was that
headed by Adolf Damaschke, who was the candidate opposing Hindenberg for
the presidency of the German Republic. Damaschke, whose book has been
cited above, extended the theory of Henry George to urban property and
succeeded in having a *surplus-value tax* imposed on owners of
cultivated land that was sold at a high price for the expansion of urban
centers. This tax was later adopted by several countries. In recent
years Dr. Carlos P. Carranza has defended and developed this theory in a
very interesting way.[^fn8]

The doctrine of ground rent is based on two errors, one factual and the
other theoretical. The first is the scarcity of land of
first-rate quality. This scarcity has become
especially noticeable in Europe as a result of overpopulation and the
restrictions imposed on immigration in the comparatively less
intensively cultivated countries. In reality, there are still in the
world vast areas of land of first-rate quality that have not yet been
cultivated, as the famous explorer Earl Parker Hanson shows in his very
interesting book, *New Worlds
Emerging*;[^fn9] and, as a
French economist has recently observed, it is absurd that these lands
are still not under cultivation, and that large sums of money are being
spent on freight costs to supply the overpopulated countries, when it
would be better for everybody if the excess population of these
countries could migrate to the idle lands, cultivate them, and live off
their produce. In the second place, as Ludwig von Mises has pointed
out,[^fn10] land is nothing
but a factor of production like machinery or tools. One may not speak
simply of land in general, but of land of different quality and
productivity, just as one must take account of machines or tools of
different quality, and the owner of a superior machine or tool also can
be said to derive a differential "rent" from it in comparison with the
returns yielded by inferior equipment. This is why they command
different prices in the market, and it cannot be said that the owner of
land of good quality whose rent has already been capitalized in the
higher price paid for it derives an unearned increment from its
exploitation.
